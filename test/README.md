TDC Test Suite

Welcome to the test suite of TDC application.

Framework used: **Mocha & Chai**

You might wonder why MochaJS was used and not Jest. Once jest was installed and one test case was run, I got an error to check [this page](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/jest.html) in the mongoose documentation which states

>Because Jest is designed primarily for testing React applications, using it to test Node.js server-side applications comes with a lot of caveats. We strongly advise against using Jest for testing any Node.js apps
